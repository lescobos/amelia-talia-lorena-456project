### What is the connection between the three Case Studies?

The connecting factor between the three case studies is the overall rise in ocean temperatures which are impacted by El Niño and La Niña events. Temperature affects ocean chemistry which can impact different levels of the food chain. It can also affect corals and cause more coral bleaching because higher ocean temperatures leads to a decrease in oxygen. This decrease in oxygen has been found to cause an increase in coral bleaching. Additionally, temperature affects fish species because different species prefer different ocean temperatures.

Additionally, the increase in ocean temperatures increases the intensity of competition beyond normal patterns. If the ocean temperature increases, then chemical concentrations will change which will cause more coral bleaching events which will then impact fish populations who need corals to survive (either for homes or food). This cycle is never ending and is not natural simply due to climate change.

To answer our research question, ocean health can be measured by so many different metrics and is variable so it is hard to quantify how “healthy” the ocean is at any given point in time. In this project we looked at three metrics: 1) coral bleaching, 2) chemical concentrations, and 3) fish populations. Even though there are many more metrics that impact overall ocean health, we do see that across all the case studies, climate change (specifically El Niño and La Niña) does have a huge impact! This is a crucial finding because we can easily change our habits to reduce/slow the impact of global warming which could then actually make the ocean healthier! 


### What can you do?

The great thing about the ocean and climate change is that we can actually make a huge difference just by changing a some habits! Listed below are just a couple of ideas if you want to help make the oceans healthier.

**Help decrease amount of Greenhouse Gases (GHGs):** GHGs trap heat in the Earth’s atmosphere. This causes an increase in temperature (including ocean temperatures). One way to decrease the amount og GHGs would be to start using hybrid or electric cars. 

**Buy Local and Sustainable Seafood:** Buy locally caught and sustainable seafood. Buying local not only supports the local economy but also decreases the need for boats that emit GHGs. 

**3 R's:** Reduce, reuse, recycle! Throwing out plastics impact lots of marine life if the plastic is sent to a landfill. However, it could also create more GHGs that we don't want if it gets sent to a trash incinerator which is a place that burns trash. 

**Be open to learn:** One of the greatest things that we can do is be open to learning! Whether that means asking questions or doing some research, it is important to learn about the climate related issues. For starters, check out the [USA Environmental Protection Agency](https://www.epa.gov/climate-change), [United Nations](https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/what-is-climate-change), [NASA](https://climate.nasa.gov/), and [National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration](https://www.noaa.gov/education/resource-collections/climate). 


### Future Research/Next Steps

For future research we would Look into ocean health and climate change indicators in more recent years. For example, the coral bleaching data only goes up until 2012 so getting more recent data would add to the story and provide new insights on recent climate change impacts. Similarly, for coral bleaching, we would look more into ocean acidification effects on the number of bleaching events along with El Niño and La Niña. Additionally, if there was unlimited data access, then looking at one specific area instead of the whole world would be interesting. Our trends of the data were seen across the globe but we wonder whether the same trends would be found if we looked at coral bleaching, ocean chemistry, and fish populations in one location.
