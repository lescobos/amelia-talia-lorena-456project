### What is the Connection Between the three Case Studies?

Our research question was how is ocean health changing due to climate related increases in temperature?

The connecting factor between the three case studies is the overall rise in ocean temperatures which are impacted by El Niño and La Niña events. Temperature affects ocean chemistry which can impact different levels of the food chain. It can also effects corals and cause more coral bleaching because higher ocean temperatures leads to a decrease in oxygen. This decrease in oxygen has been found to cause an increase in coral bleaching. Additionally, temperature impacts fish species because different species prefer different temperatures.

Additionally, the increase in ocean temperatures increases the intensity of competition beyond normal patterns. If temperature increases, then chemical concentrations will change which will cause more coral bleaching events which will then impact fish populations who need corals to survive (either for homes or food). This cycle of chemical concentration to coral bleaching to decrease in fish populations in a never ending cycle and it not natural simply due to climate change.

### Why is this website important?

#### What can you do?

Now we know how climate related temperature impacts ocean health so what can you as the reader of this website do to

### Future Research/Next Steps

For future research we would Look into ocean health and climate change indicators in more recent years. For example, the coral bleaching data only goes up until 2012 so getting more recent data would add to the story and provide new insights on recent climate change impacts. Additionally, if there was unlimited data access, then looking at one specific area instead of the whole world would be interesting. Our trends of the data were seen across the globe but we wonder whether the same trends would be found if we looked at coral bleaching, ocean chemistry, and fish populations in one location.
