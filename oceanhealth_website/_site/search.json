    "text": "In this project, we looked at Ocean Health as an indicator of climate change. Climate change/global warming is the event in which air pollution, runoff, and other things cause our Earth’s temperature to increase. This is why there have been colder winters and hotter summers or more extreme weather events. You may be asking yourself, how do we know climate change is happening? Well, take a look at the graph below. This graph shows the annual temperature anomalies (or differences from the mean of 0). As seen, the graph has a positive correlation between time and temperature. This shows that over time there is an overall increase in sea surface temperatures.\n\n\nCode\nSST %>% \n  group_by() %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = Annual_anomaly)) + \n  geom_line() + \n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color = \"Orange\", size = 1) +\n  theme_classic() + \n # scale_x_discrete(c(1880, 1890, 1900, 1910, 1920, 1930, 1940, 1950, 1960, 1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, 2010)) +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(family = \"mono\", face = \"bold\", size = 12, ),\n        plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n        plot.caption = element_text(family = \"mono\"),\n        plot.subtitle = element_text(family = \"mono\"),\n        axis.title.y = element_text(family = \"mono\"),\n        axis.title.x = element_text(family = \"mono\", vjust = 0.5)) +\n  labs(title = \"Annual Average Sea Surface Temperature Anomalies\",\n       subtitle = \"from 1880 to 2020\", \n       x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Annual Anomaly\",\n       caption = \"Plot created by Talia Chait\")\n\n\nWarning: Using `size` aesthetic for lines was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use `linewidth` instead.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to dive deeper into the effects of climate change on ocean health, we considered 3 different locations all around the world that we are calling “case studies” all of which help answer our research questions: 1) How is ocean health changing over time? and 2) How is ocean health changing due to climate change?\nThe first case study looks into coral bleaching specifically in Australia, where the great barrier reef is, and tackles the effects of La Niña vs El Niño. The second case study looks into chemicals off the coast of Santa Barbara, California, USA to take a different approach on how ocean health is chaning over time. The third case study looks into fish populations in the Mediterranean Sea as an indicator of ocean health. The tabs on this website correspond to each of the case studies, so please click on whichever tab you are most interested in to learn more about that topic!\n\n\nCode\nworld <- ne_countries(scale = \"medium\", returnclass = \"sf\")\nclass(world)\n\n\n[1] \"sf\"         \"data.frame\"\n\n\nCode\nggplot(data = world) + \n  geom_sf() + \n  annotate(\"point\", x = 134, y = -25, color = \"cyan1\", size = 4) + \n  annotate(\"label\", x = 137, y = -37, label = \"Case Study 1\") +\n  annotate(\"point\", x = -120, y = 34, color = \"orange\", size = 4) + \n  annotate(\"label\", x = -120, y = 22, label = \"Case Study 2\") +\n  annotate(\"point\", x = 19, y = 35, color = \"hotpink\", size = 4) + \n  annotate(\"label\", x = 19, y = 47, label = \"Case Study 3\") +\n  theme_classic() +\n  labs (y = \"\", \n        x = \"\",\n        title = \"Overview of Case Study Locations\") + \n  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\"))\n\n\n\n\n\nNow you may be asking, well why is this important or what is the big deal looking into ocean health.

    "section": "",
    "text": "What is Coral Bleaching?\nCoral Bleaching is the act of corals losing their vibrant colors and turning white through being stressed. The leading cause of coral bleaching is climate change. This includes an increase in ocean temperature, overexposure to sunlight, or harmful nutrients from runoff or pollution. Any of these conditions could cause the coral to expel the symbiotic algae living in their tissues which in turn causes the corals to turn completely white - hence the bleaching term.\n\n\n\nImage Caption: A coral reef that is healthy (on the left) versus a coral reef that is bleached (on the right) - source: Greenspace\n\n\n\n\nWhy is it important?\nIt is important to remember that while corals are not necessarily “dead” from a coral bleaching event, it is still crucial to make sure they survive the bleaching events. Corals provide resources to many species that call the ocean their homes. By understanding the patterns in coral bleaching and bleaching severity, we can evaluate ocean health and understand what we can do to prevent more coral reefs from being bleached and ultimately prevent more damage to our oceans.\n\n\nData, Visualizations, and Results\nData was obtained from Harvard Dataverse (link to data) which is a free data repository that is open to all researchers from any discipline (both inside and outside of Harvard University). It allows researchers to share, archive, cite, and access different data-sets. It was published to the repository in 2016 but has data from the mid 1800s.\nSince this data-set is on corals, the ethical issues have to do with gathering information from marine life and and how much the data collection could cause harms. While the harms are minor, the benefits of this data being collected goes well beyond the health of the corals. This is because coral bleaching is an indicator of climate change so collecting data on the health of corals could have lasting impacts on reducing global warming.\n\n\nCode\ncoralcountperregion <- coralbleaching %>% \n  group_by(REGION, YEAR) %>%\n  summarise(REGION, YEAR) %>% \n   count()\n\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'REGION', 'YEAR'.
