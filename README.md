# Welcome to our Projects in Data Science Github Repository! 

This project was completed by Amelia Renner, Talia Chait, and Lorean Escobosa-Alcantar. 

For our topic, we were looking into how ocean health changes due to climate related temperature increases? In order to best answer this question, we structured our project in the form of three case studies all of which tell a crucial part of the story. The three case studies are coral bleaching in Australia, ocean chemistry in California, USA, and fish populations in the Mediterranean Sea. In order to make this more widely accesible, we created a quarto website. Check out this link to learn more and read about the case studies: https://lescobos.github.io/amelia-talia-lorena-456project/ 

**Data dependencies:** Each case study has different data that went along with the analysis and visualizations. 

**Code dependencies:**
