    "text": "What is Coral Bleaching?\nCoral Bleaching is the act of corals losing their vibrant colors and turning white through being stressed. The leading cause of coral bleaching is climate change. This includes an increase in ocean temperature, overexposure to sunlight, or harmful nutrients from runoff or pollution. Any of these conditions could cause the coral to expel the symbiotic algae living in their tissues which in turn causes the corals to turn completely white - hence the bleaching term.\n\n\n\nImage Caption: A coral reef that is healthy (on the left) versus a coral reef that is bleached (on the right) - source: Greenspace\n\n\n\n\nWhy is it important?\nIt is important to remember that while corals are not necessarily “dead” from a coral bleaching event, it is still crucial to make sure they survive the bleaching events. Corals provide resources to many species that call the ocean their homes. By understanding the patterns in coral bleaching and bleaching severity, we can evaluate ocean health and understand what we can do to prevent more coral reefs from being bleached and ultimately prevent more damage to our oceans.\n\n\nData, Visualizations, and Results\nData was obtained from Harvard Dataverse (link to data) which is a free data repository that is open to all researchers from any discipline (both inside and outside of Harvard University). It allows researchers to share, archive, cite, and access different data-sets. It was published to the repository in 2016 but has data from the mid 1800s.\nSince this data-set is on corals, the ethical issues have to do with gathering information from marine life and and how much the data collection could cause harms. While the harms are minor, the benefits of this data being collected goes well beyond the health of the corals. This is because coral bleaching is an indicator of climate change so collecting data on the health of corals could have lasting impacts on reducing global warming.\n\nWhy Australia?\nWhile coral bleaching effects corals and coral reefs worldwide, I decided to focus in on Australia because Australia is home to the Great Barrier Reef. The Great Barrier Reef is one of the largest, most popular coral reefs across the globe. The visualization below shows all the bleaching events that occurred in Australia from 1980 to 2010. As seen on the graphic, there is a congestion of bleaching events (points) near the Great Barrier Reef. So if the Great Barrier Reef has the most concentrated amount of bleaching events over time, then why is it so concentrated - despite the fact that it is a coral reef? Well, turns out the climate patterns of El Niño and La Niña could have that impact.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(data = world) +\n  geom_sf() +\n  geom_point(data = coralbleaching, aes(x = LON, y = LAT), size = 2, \n        shape = 23, fill = \"darkred\") +\n  coord_sf(xlim = c(100, 160), ylim = c(-50, 0), expand = FALSE) +\n  theme_void() + \n  labs(title = \"Coral Bleaching Events in Australia\",\n       y = \"\",\n       x = \"\",\n       caption = \"Map by T. Chait | Source: Harvard Dataverse\") +\n    theme(legend.position = \"none\",\n        plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 12, ),\n        plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n        axis.title.x = element_text(vjust = 0.5))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEl Niño/La Niña Events and Coral Bleaching\nThe climate patterns of El Niño and La Niña are known to impact surface temperature. El Niño years general result in warmer ocean temperatures while La Niña years generally result in cooler ocean temperatures. As we know, coral bleaching is most impacted by an increase in ocean temperature (hence during El Niño years the number of coral bleaching events should increase). On the contrary, it is expected that during La Niña years, the number of bleaching events should decrease due to the cooler ocean temperatures. In fact, according to the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, La Niña years tend to prevent mass coral bleaching events! For the purpose of simplicity, only four years were chosen to be analyzed: two El Niño years and two La Niña years. The El Niño years were 1997 and 2002 while the La Niña years were 2007 and 2009. The El Niño in 1997 was categorized as “very strong” and the El Niño in 2002 was categorized as “moderate”. Both of the La Niña years were categorized as “strong”. The reason why these years were chosen was mostly based off the data that was available for coral bleaching events and what the data was showing.\nAs seen in the line graph below, the two spikes in the number of bleaching events are directly correlated with the El Niño very strong year in 1997 and the moderate year in 2002. Comparing the El Niño and La Niña years shows us that the El Niño event in 1997 caused 1244 bleaching events while the La Niña strong in 1999 caused 13 bleaching events. This is a significant difference between the number of coral bleaching ebents that occurred in Australia. This makes sense with difference between effects of El Niño and La Niña.\n\n\nCode\ncoralcountperregion %>%\n  filter(REGION == \"Australia\") %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = YEAR, y = n)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  theme_classic() +\n  scale_x_discrete(limits = c(1980, 1985, 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010)) +\n  annotate(\"point\", x = 1998, y= 1244, size = 3, color = \"red\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 2002.5, y = 1244, label = \"El Niño '97 (very strong)\", color = \"red\") +\n  annotate(\"point\", x = 2002, y= 644, size = 3, color = \"red\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 2006, y = 644, label = \"El Niño '02 (moderate)\", color = \"red\") +\n  annotate(\"point\", x = 2007, y= 28, size = 3, color = \"blue\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 2007, y = 110, label = \"La Niña '07 (strong)\", color = \"blue\") +\n  annotate(\"point\", x = 1999, y= 13, size = 3, color = \"blue\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 1999, y = -35, label = \"La Niña '99 (strong)\", color = \"blue\") +\n  labs(x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"\",\n       title = \"Number of Bleaching Events in Australia from 1980 to 2010\",\n       caption = \" Graphic by T.

The results suggests that there is an increase in bleaching severity during El Niño years as opposed to during La Niña years. This is also significant because comparing the graph below to the graph above, we can see a similar pattern with regards to the spikes and which years they correspond to. For example, the previous graph shows that more than 1200 bleaching events occurred during the El Niño event in 1997. While, the graph below shows that more than 0.2 percent of the bleaching events in 1997 were medium and high severity. The fact that these two graphs have the same big increase in amount/percent during the same year which happens to be an El Niño yea shows us that El Niño (and La Niña) years have a huge effect on coral bleaching which directly relates back to ocean health.\n\n\nCode\ncoralcountperregionbleach %>%\n  filter(REGION == \"Australia\", \n         BLEACHING_SEVERITY %in% c(\"HIGH\", \"Medium\")) %>%\n  group_by(YEAR) %>% \n  mutate(sumperyear = sum(n)) %>% \n  summarize(REGION, YEAR, sumperyear) %>% \n  unique() %>% \n  mutate(percentMedHigh = sumperyear/2229) %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x = YEAR, y = percentMedHigh)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  theme_classic() +\n  scale_x_discrete(limits = c(1991, 1996, 2001, 2006)) +\n  annotate(\"point\", x = 1998, y= 0.2265589951   , size = 3, color = \"red\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 2000.75, y = 0.2265589951    , label = \"El Niño '97 (very strong)\", color = \"red\") +\n  annotate(\"point\", x = 2002, y= 0.10, size = 3, color = \"red\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 2004.5, y = 0.10, label = \"El Niño '02 (moderate)\", color = \"red\") +\n  annotate(\"point\", x = 2007, y= 0, size = 3, color = \"blue\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 2007, y = -0.01, label = \"La Niña '07 (strong)\", color = \"blue\") +\n  annotate(\"point\", x = 1999, y= 0.0013458950, size = 3, color = \"blue\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 1999, y = -0.01, label = \"La Niña '99 (strong)\", color = \"blue\") +\n  labs(x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"\",\n       title = \"Percent of Medium and High Bleaching Events in Australia\",\n       subtitle = \"(from 1991 to 2009)\",\n       caption = \"Graphic by T.

This graph takes the information learned in the previous two graphs and incorporates spatial mapping to better visualize where the coral bleaching is occurring. However, only the years 1998, 1999, 2002, and 2006 are shown on the graph because those are the four El Niño and La Niña years. The results show that the most bleaching events in the area of the Great Barrier Reef occurred in 1998 and 2002. However, it turns out that 1998 and 2002 are strong and moderate El Niño years (as discussed all along with this case study).\n\n\nCode\ncoralbleachmedhigh4yrs <- coralbleachmedhigh %>% \n  filter(YEAR %in% c(\"1998\", \"1999\", \"2002\", \"2006\")) %>% \n  mutate(Yeartype = ifelse(YEAR %in% c(\"1998\", \"2002\"), \"El Niño\", \"La Niña\")) \n\nggplot(data = world) +\n  geom_sf() +\n  geom_point(data = coralbleachmedhigh4yrs, aes(x = LON, y = LAT, fill = BLEACHING_SEVERITY), size = 2, shape = 23) +\n  facet_wrap(Yeartype~YEAR) + \n  coord_sf(xlim = c(140, 160), ylim = c(-30, -10), expand = FALSE) +\n  theme_void() + \n  labs(title = \"Coral Bleaching Events in Australia\",\n       subtitle = \"near Great Barrier Reef\",\n       y = \"\",\n       x = \"\",\n       fill = \"Bleaching Severity\",\n       caption = \"Map by T.

This is important to know because coral is home to many marine species and provides homes, resources, and nutrients to lots of marine life. If more coral to became bleached then that means some marine life species could be without a home or food source. It is important for us humans to think about the implications and lasting effects of our actions not just on ourselves but also the other life forms that call Earth their home!\nAdditionally, it is important to note that we don’t know whether the trends seen in this case study are magnified due to the researchers simply collecting more data during the El Niño years when compared to the La Niña years. It seems as though the trends are seen in many different ways that this would not be the case but when dealing with data it is important to keep in mind!\n\n\nResources\nData: Harvard Dataverse\nNOAA: What is Coral Bleaching\nggweather: El Niño and La Niña Years and Intensities\nGreenspace: Coral Image\nNational Geographic: El Niño vs La Niña"

    "text": "What is the Connection Between the three Case Studies?\nOur research question was how is ocean health changing due to climate related increases in temperature?\nThe connecting factor between the three case studies is the overall rise in ocean temperatures which are impacted by El Niño and La Niña events. Temperature affects ocean chemistry which can impact different levels of the food chain. It can also effects corals and cause more coral bleaching because higher ocean temperatures leads to a decrease in oxygen. This decrease in oxygen has been found to cause an increase in coral bleaching. Additionally, temperature impacts fish species because different species prefer different temperatures.\nAdditionally, the increase in ocean temperatures increases the intensity of competition beyond normal patterns. If temperature increases, then chemical concentrations will change which will cause more coral bleaching events which will then impact fish populations who need corals to survive (either for homes or food). This cycle of chemical concentration to coral bleaching to decrease in fish populations in a never ending cycle and it not natural simply due to climate change.\n\n\nWhy is this website important?\n\nWhat can you do?\nNow we know how climate related temperature impacts ocean health so what can you as the reader of this website do to\n\n\n\nFuture Research/Next Steps\nFor future research we would Look into ocean health and climate change indicators in more recent years. For example, the coral bleaching data only goes up until 2012 so getting more recent data would add to the story and provide new insights on recent climate change impacts. Additionally, if there was unlimited data access, then looking at one specific area instead of the whole world would be interesting. Our trends of the data were seen across the globe but we wonder whether the same trends would be found if we looked at coral bleaching, ocean chemistry, and fish populations in one location.\n\n\nResources"
