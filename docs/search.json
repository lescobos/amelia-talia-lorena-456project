    "text": "What is Coral Bleaching?\nCoral Bleaching is the act of corals losing their vibrant colors and turning white through being stressed. The leading cause of coral bleaching is climate change. This includes an increase in ocean temperature, overexposure to sunlight, or harmful nutrients from runoff or pollution. Any of these conditions could cause the coral to expel the symbiotic algae living in their tissues which in turn causes the corals to turn completely white - hence the bleaching term.\n\n\n\nImage Caption: A coral reef that is healthy (on the left) versus a coral reef that is bleached (on the right) - source: Greenspace\n\n\n\n\nWhy is it important?\nIt is important to remember that while corals are not necessarily “dead” from a coral bleaching event, it is still crucial to make sure they survive the bleaching events. Corals provide resources to many species that call the ocean their homes. By understanding the patterns in coral bleaching and bleaching severity, we can evaluate ocean health and understand what we can do to prevent more coral reefs from being bleached and ultimately prevent more damage to our oceans.\n\n\nData, Visualizations, and Results\nData was obtained from Harvard Dataverse (link to data) which is a free data repository that is open to all researchers from any discipline (both inside and outside of Harvard University). It allows researchers to share, archive, cite, and access different data-sets. It was published to the repository in 2016 but has data from the mid 1800s.\nSince this data-set is on corals, the ethical issues have to do with gathering information from marine life and and how much the data collection could cause harms. While the harms are minor, the benefits of this data being collected goes well beyond the health of the corals. This is because coral bleaching is an indicator of climate change so collecting data on the health of corals could have lasting impacts on reducing global warming.\n\nWhy Australia?\nWhile coral bleaching effects corals and coral reefs worldwide, I decided to focus in on Australia because Australia is home to the Great Barrier Reef. The Great Barrier Reef is one of the largest, most popular coral reefs across the globe. The visualization below shows all the bleaching events that occurred in Australia from 1980 to 2010. As seen on the graphic, there is a congestion of bleaching events (points) near the Great Barrier Reef. So if the Great Barrier Reef has the most concentrated amount of bleaching events over time, then why is it so concentrated - despite the fact that it is a coral reef? Well, turns out the climate patterns of El Niño and La Niña could have that impact.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(data = world) +\n  geom_sf() +\n  geom_point(data = coralbleaching, aes(x = LON, y = LAT), size = 2, \n        shape = 23, fill = \"darkred\") +\n  coord_sf(xlim = c(100, 160), ylim = c(-50, 0), expand = FALSE) +\n  theme_void() + \n  labs(title = \"Coral Bleaching Events in Australia\",\n       y = \"\",\n       x = \"\",\n       caption = \"Map by T.

El Niño years general result in warmer ocean temperatures while La Niña years generally result in cooler ocean temperatures. As we know, coral bleaching is most impacted by an increase in ocean temperature (hence during El Niño years the number of coral bleaching events should increase). On the contrary, it is expected that during La Niña years, the number of bleaching events should decrease due to the cooler ocean temperatures. In fact, according to the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, La Niña years tend to prevent mass coral bleaching events! For the purpose of simplicity, only four years were chosen to be analyzed: two El Niño years and two La Niña years. The El Niño years were 1997 and 2002 while the La Niña years were 2007 and 2009. The El Niño in 1997 was categorized as “very strong” and the El Niño in 2002 was categorized as “moderate”. Both of the La Niña years were categorized as “strong”. The reason why these years were chosen was mostly based off the data that was available for coral bleaching events and what the data was showing.\nAs seen in the line graph below, the two spikes in the number of bleaching events are directly correlated with the El Niño very strong year in 1997 and the moderate year in 2002. Comparing the El Niño and La Niña years shows us that the El Niño event in 1997 caused 1244 bleaching events while the La Niña strong in 1999 caused 13 bleaching events. This is a significant difference between the number of coral bleaching ebents that occurred in Australia. This makes sense with difference between effects of El Niño and La Niña.\n\n\nCode\ncoralcountperregion %>%\n  filter(REGION == \"Australia\") %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = YEAR, y = n)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  theme_classic() +\n  scale_x_discrete(limits = c(1980, 1985, 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010)) +\n  annotate(\"point\", x = 1998, y= 1244, size = 3, color = \"red\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 2002.5, y = 1244, label = \"El Niño '97 (very strong)\", color = \"red\") +\n  annotate(\"point\", x = 2002, y= 644, size = 3, color = \"red\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 2006, y = 644, label = \"El Niño '02 (moderate)\", color = \"red\") +\n  annotate(\"point\", x = 2007, y= 28, size = 3, color = \"blue\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 2007, y = 110, label = \"La Niña '07 (strong)\", color = \"blue\") +\n  annotate(\"point\", x = 1999, y= 13, size = 3, color = \"blue\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 1999, y = -35, label = \"La Niña '99 (strong)\", color = \"blue\") +\n  labs(x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"\",\n       title = \"Number of Bleaching Events in Australia from 1980 to 2010\",\n       caption = \" Graphic by T.

The results suggests that there is an increase in bleaching severity during El Niño years as opposed to during La Niña years. This is also significant because comparing the graph below to the graph above, we can see a similar pattern with regards to the spikes and which years they correspond to. For example, the previous graph shows that more than 1200 bleaching events occurred during the El Niño event in 1997. While, the graph below shows that more than 0.2 percent of the bleaching events in 1997 were medium and high severity. The fact that these two graphs have the same big increase in amount/percent during the same year which happens to be an El Niño yea shows us that El Niño (and La Niña) years have a huge effect on coral bleaching which directly relates back to ocean health.\n\n\nCode\ncoralcountperregionbleach %>%\n  filter(REGION == \"Australia\", \n         BLEACHING_SEVERITY %in% c(\"HIGH\", \"Medium\")) %>%\n  group_by(YEAR) %>% \n  mutate(sumperyear = sum(n)) %>% \n  summarize(REGION, YEAR, sumperyear) %>% \n  unique() %>% \n  mutate(percentMedHigh = sumperyear/2229) %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x = YEAR, y = percentMedHigh)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  theme_classic() +\n  scale_x_discrete(limits = c(1991, 1996, 2001, 2006)) +\n  annotate(\"point\", x = 1998, y= 0.2265589951   , size = 3, color = \"red\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 2000.75, y = 0.2265589951    , label = \"El Niño '97 (very strong)\", color = \"red\") +\n  annotate(\"point\", x = 2002, y= 0.10, size = 3, color = \"red\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 2004.5, y = 0.10, label = \"El Niño '02 (moderate)\", color = \"red\") +\n  annotate(\"point\", x = 2007, y= 0, size = 3, color = \"blue\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 2007, y = -0.01, label = \"La Niña '07 (strong)\", color = \"blue\") +\n  annotate(\"point\", x = 1999, y= 0.0013458950, size = 3, color = \"blue\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 1999, y = -0.01, label = \"La Niña '99 (strong)\", color = \"blue\") +\n  labs(x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"\",\n       title = \"Percent of Medium and High Bleaching Events in Australia\",\n       subtitle = \"(from 1991 to 2009)\",\n       caption = \"Graphic by T.

This graph takes the information learned in the previous two graphs and incorporates spatial mapping to better visualize where the coral bleaching is occurring. However, only the years 1998, 1999, 2002, and 2006 are shown on the graph because those are the four El Niño and La Niña years. The results show that the most bleaching events in the area of the Great Barrier Reef occurred in 1998 and 2002. However, it turns out that 1998 and 2002 are strong and moderate El Niño years (as discussed all along with this case study).\n\n\nCode\ncoralbleachmedhigh4yrs <- coralbleachmedhigh %>% \n  filter(YEAR %in% c(\"1998\", \"1999\", \"2002\", \"2006\")) %>% \n  mutate(Yeartype = ifelse(YEAR %in% c(\"1998\", \"2002\"), \"El Niño\", \"La Niña\")) \n\nggplot(data = world) +\n  geom_sf() +\n  geom_point(data = coralbleachmedhigh4yrs, aes(x = LON, y = LAT, fill = BLEACHING_SEVERITY), size = 2, shape = 23) +\n  facet_wrap(Yeartype~YEAR) + \n  coord_sf(xlim = c(140, 160), ylim = c(-30, -10), expand = FALSE) +\n  theme_void() + \n  labs(title = \"Coral Bleaching Events in Australia\",\n       subtitle = \"near Great Barrier Reef\",\n       y = \"\",\n       x = \"\",\n       fill = \"Bleaching Severity\",\n       caption = \"Map by T.

This is important to know because coral is home to many marine species and provides homes, resources, and nutrients to lots of marine life. If more coral to became bleached then that means some marine life species could be without a home or food source. It is important for us humans to think about the implications and lasting effects of our actions not just on ourselves but also the other life forms that call Earth their home!\nAdditionally, it is important to note that we don’t know whether the trends seen in this case study are magnified due to the researchers simply collecting more data during the El Niño years when compared to the La Niña years. It seems as though the trends are seen in many different ways that this would not be the case but when dealing with data it is important to keep in mind!\n\n\nResources\nData: Harvard Dataverse\nNOAA: What is Coral Bleaching\nggweather: El Niño and La Niña Years and Intensities\nGreenspace: Coral Image\nNational Geographic: El Niño vs La Niña"

    "text": "What is the connection between the three case studies?\nWe investigated how ocean health is changing due to climate change related increases in temperature.\nThe connecting factor between the three case studies is the overall rise in ocean temperatures due to climate change. These changes are especially severe during El Niño and La Niña events. Temperature affects ocean chemistry, which can further impact different levels of the food chain. Higher ocean temperatures can cause algae blooms or affect concentrations of dissolved chemicals, which alter the ecosystems that marine creatures depend on. Also, higher temperatures are associated with increases in coral bleaching because higher ocean temperatures leads to a decrease in dissolved oxygen. Decreases in dissolved oxygen have been found to cause increased coral bleaching. This decrease in oxygen has been found to cause an increase in coral bleaching. Additionally, temperature can impact fish species that depend on ocean temperatures. Fish species that prefer water of different temperatures will be unable to live within normal ranges as temperatures shift due to climate change. This will likely result in a mismatch of predators, prey, and resources, causing decreases in fish and predator populations.\nAdditionally, the increase in ocean temperatures will likely increase fish competition intensity beyond normal patterns. Shifting species habitat ranges will result in increased competition, leading to species population decreases. As temperatures increase, ocean chemical concentrations and dissolved oxygen will change, leading to more coral bleaching events. This in turn will affect the myriad species that depend on corals for food and forage. This cycle of shifting chemical concentrations affecting coral bleaching affecting fish populations is a vicious cycle due to anthropogenic (originating in human activity) climate change.\n\n\nWhat can you do?\nThe great thing about the ocean and climate change is that we can actually make a huge difference just by changing a some habits! Listed below are just a couple of ideas if you want to help make the oceans healthier.\nHelp decrease amount of Greenhouse Gases (GHGs): GHGs trap heat in the Earth’s atmosphere. This causes an increase in temperature (including ocean temperatures). One way to decrease the amount og GHGs would be to start using hybrid or electric cars.\nBuy Local and Sustainable Seafood: Buy locally caught and sustainable seafood. Buying local not only supports the local economy but also decreases the need for boats that emit GHGs.\n3 R’s: Reduce, reuse, recycle! Throwing out plastics impact lots of marine life if the plastic is sent to a landfill. However, it could also create more GHGs that we don’t want if it gets sent to a trash incinerator which is a place that burns trash.\nBe open to learn: One of the greatest things that we can do is be open to learning! Whether that means asking questions or doing some research, it is important to learn about the climate related issues. For starters, check out the USA Environmental Protection Agency, United Nations, NASA, and National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration.\n\n\nFuture Research/Next Steps\nFor future research we would Look into ocean health and climate change indicators in more recent years. For example, the coral bleaching data only goes up until 2012 so getting more recent data would add to the story and provide new insights on recent climate change impacts. Similarly, for coral bleaching, we would look more into ocean acidification effects on the number of bleaching events along with El Niño and La Niña. Additionally, if there was unlimited data access, then looking at one specific area instead of the whole world would be interesting. Our trends of the data were seen across the globe but we wonder whether the same trends would be found if we looked at coral bleaching, ocean chemistry, and fish populations in one location.\n\n\nResources\nEnvironment: How to stop Ocean warming\nUSA Environmental Protection Agency: Climate Change\nUnited Nations: What is climate change?\nNASA: Global Climate Change\nNational Ocean and Atmospheric Administration: Climate Resource Collection"

    "text": "What is Ocean Chemistry?\n\nImage Source: EPA Archive\nOcean chemistry refers to chemicals that are present in the ocean, as well as the behaviors of those chemicals over time. Common marine chemicals include salts, dissolved gasses, and anthropogenic pollutants. Researchers monitor common chemical concentrations to look for indications of how climate change is affecting the world’s marine environments.\nClimate change is a phenomenon that affects the entire globe. Over time, our world’s oceans are heating as average ambient temperatures rise. Temperature is a large controller of chemical activity; chemicals behave differently at different temperatures. So, how would changing ocean temperatures contribute to differences in ocean chemistry?\n\n\nWhy is Ocean Chemistry important?\nOcean chemistry involves everything that makes up seawater. Seawater is a unique substance that thousands of species depend on, from the smallest bacteria to coral reefs to massive marine mammals.\npH is one unique metric of ocean chemistry. pH is a number that refers to how acidic or alkaline a liquid is. A smaller number indicates a more acidic substance, while a larger number indicates a more alkaline or basic liquid.\nOcean pH was approximately 8.2 before industrialization, or when humans began emitting large amounts of greenhouse gasses into the environment. Oceans are becoming more acidic over time because of increased carbon emissions.\nMany marine organisms are sensitive to even small changes in pH. Animals that build their skeletons from carbon are especially sensitive. Measuring pH and other indicators of ocean health are important for predicting changes in sensitive marine species.\n Image Source: EPA\n\n\nCode\n#tiff <- raster(\"MYD28M_2022-12-01_rgb_3600x1800.FLOAT.TIFF\")\n\n#rastr <- rasterToPoints(tiff, spatial = TRUE)\n\n#dfrastr <- data.frame(rastr)\n\n#dfrastr %>%\n#  mutate(MYD28M_2022.12.01_rgb_3600x1800.FLOAT = na_if(MYD28M_2022.12.01_rgb_3600x1800.FLOAT, 99999)) %>%\n#  ggplot() + \n#  geom_raster(aes(x = x, y = y, fill = MYD28M_2022.12.01_rgb_3600x1800.FLOAT)) + \n#  ggtitle(\"\") + \n#  coord_equal() + \n#  theme_bw() + \n#  scale_fill_viridis_c(na.value = \"black\") + \n#  theme(panel.grid = element_blank(), \n#        panel.background = element_rect(fill = \"transparent\"), \n#        plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"transparent\"),\n#        panel.border = element_blank(),\n#        plot.margin = unit(c(0, 0, 0, 0), \"null\"),\n#        panel.margin = unit(c(0, 0, 0, 0), \"null\"),\n#        axis.ticks = element_blank(),\n#        axis.text = element_blank(),\n#        axis.title = element_blank(),\n#        axis.line = element_blank(),\n#        axis.ticks.length = unit(0, \"null\"),\n#        axis.ticks.margin = unit(0, \"null\"),\n#        legend.margin = margin(unit(0, \"null\")), \n#        plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\")) + \n#  annotate(\"point\", x = 134, y = -25, color = \"yellow\", size = 2) +\n#  annotate(\"label\", x = 137, y = -37, label = \"Case Study 1\") +\n#  annotate(\"point\", x = -120, y = 34, color = \"yellow\", size = 2) +\n#  annotate(\"label\", x = -120, y = 22, label = \"Case Study 2\") +\n#  annotate(\"point\", x = 19, y = 35, color = \"yellow\", size = 2) +\n#  annotate(\"label\", x = 19, y = 47, label = \"Case Study 3\") + \n#  labs(fill = \"Temperature\\n(ºC)\", title = \"Water Temperature from MODIS Satellite Data, December 2022\", caption = \"Graphic by A.

ENSO causes temperature anomalies over specific years, and our investigation required examination of the extent of ENSO in our study sites.\nOur visualization shows that ENSO contributes to some of the anomalies seen at the Santa Barbara Site. The greatest temperature peak occurred 2015-2016, which was a year characterized as a strong El Niño year.\nHowever, the temperature peak in 2019 occurred during a year with a small El Niño impact. Impacts of the strong La Niña year in 2011 were not evident in daily ocean temperature measurements.\nThis disconnection between Santa Barbara ocean temperatures indicates that more of the variation we see in temperatures is due to something other than ENSO. This is an important consideration as we continue to investigate ocean chemistry changes; ENSO does not unilaterally control ocean temperature in Santa Barbara.\nAlthough ENSO effects aren’t the only major driver of temperature differences in Santa Barbara, does temperature affect marine chemicals?\nThis investigation was driven by the hypothesis that warmer temperatures would produce algae blooms, which occur during periods of warmth. Algae blooms are harmful because algae grow and consume all available resources, then die after resources are depleted. Once they die, they decompose through a process that requires oxygen. This depletes dissolved oxygen concentrations and affects any marine organism that respires, including fish and marine mammals.\nAn increase in algal activity would be evident through peaks in aqueous chlorophyll. Chlorophyll is the pigment that makes plants green.\n\n\nCode\ncce %>%\n  mutate(Month = as.numeric(str_sub(Year, start = 5))) %>%\n  mutate(Season = ifelse(Month <= 0.9 & Month >= 0.4, \"Warm\", \"Cool\")) %>%\n  filter(Season == \"Cool\") %>%\n  ggplot() +\n  geom_col(aes(y = Temp.Anomaly..C., x = Year, color = Temp.Anomaly..C. > 0)) +\n  geom_smooth(aes(y = Chl..µg.L., x = Year), color = \"dark green\", se = FALSE) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"blue\", \"red\")) + \n  theme_bw() + \n  theme(legend.position = \"none\", plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\")) + \n  labs(y = \"Anomaly (ºC and µg/L)\", title = \"Temperature & Chlorophyll Anomalies, CCE LTER Station, winter 1984-2019\", subtitle = \"Bars represent temperature (ºC) anomalies and line represents chlorophyll (µg/L) anomalies\", caption = \"Graphic by A. Renner | Source: California Current Ecosystem LTER & Golden Gate Weather Service\") \n\n\n\n\n\nWe see two peaks in chlorophyll in 1999 and 2019. These peaks would indicate algae blooms occurred. These are also times associated with higher-than-normal temperatures, the red peaks that occurred in 1999 and 2015/2016. It is likely that these temperatures spurred above-average algae growth, causing a spike in chlorophyll concentrations.\nThis indicates that the impacts of algae blooms, including production of toxic chemicals and oxygen depletion, likely occurred during this time period.\nAdditionally, when algae grow, they absorb CO2. Absorbing CO2 causes a drop in pH, or an increase in acidity. Since warmer temperatures are associated with algae blooms, are they also associated with acidification?\n\n\nCode\n# preindustrial ocean ph = 8.2\n# source : https://www.epa.gov/ocean-acidification/understanding-science-ocean-and-coastal-acidification\ncalinine %>%\n  mutate(Month = as.numeric(Month)) %>%\n  mutate(MonthDec = Month/12, \n         MonthDec = str_sub(MonthDec, start = 2), \n         MonthYear = str_c(Year, MonthDec)) %>%\n  dplyr::mutate(pHAnomaly = pH - 8.2, \n                MonthYear = as.numeric(MonthYear)) %>%\n  dplyr::group_by(MonthYear) %>%\n  dplyr::summarize(meanAnomaly = mean(pHAnomaly),\n            Value = mean(Value)) %>%\n  ggplot() + \n  geom_col(aes(x = MonthYear, y = Value, fill = Value > 0)) + \n  scale_fill_manual(values=c(\"#194bff\", \"#f00a0a\")) + \n  geom_point(aes(x = MonthYear, y = meanAnomaly), size = 2) + \n  labs(x = \"Year\", y = \"Magnitude\", title = \"pH Difference from Pre-Industrial Mean versus ENSO Effects\", subtitle = \"pH differences plotted as black points, El Niño effects as red, positive lines, and La Niña \\neffects as blue, negative lines\", caption = \"Graphic by A.

The black points show how different pH measurements are from the average post-industrial pH of 8.2. A marine pH of 8.2 indicates a healthy ocean ecosystem without the effects of climate change or anthropogenic pollution.\nThis visualization shows pH anomalies are fairly consistent over time. This indicates that the ENSO effect alone does not influence algae blooms enough to yield significant changes in pH.\nThis is an important finding for two reasons:\n\nFirst, it is a good sign that El Niño years are not associated with pH increases. ENSO effects are intensifying with increased greenhouse gas emissions, meaning that ENSO-attributable acidification would only get worse in the coming decades. Since we do not see any indication of ENSO-attributable acidification, it is unlikely that ENSO intensification would significantly contribute to greater acidification in Santa Barbara marine ecosystems.\nSecond, pH anomalies are stable over time in Santa Barbara ecosystems. Although pH decreasing across the globe, the pH anomalies seen at the SBC station are stable over time. This is a promising result, since Santa Barbara is home to many diverse, important marine ecosystems that are sensitive to acidification.\n\n\n\nWhy is this case study important?\nThe Santa Barbara Coastal and California Current Environment provide a unique example of two sites in close proximity and with ample data. Ocean chemistry is a critical metric for how our marine environments are changing due to climate change.\nAwareness of the changes our oceans are experiencing is important to reduce long-term impacts, spur change, and improve ocean protection regulations.\n\n\nResources\nData sources:\nCalifornia Coastal Ecosystem LTER\nGolden Gate Weather Service (ENSO Data)\nSanta Barbara Coastal LTER"

Climate change/global warming is the event in which air pollution, runoff, and other things cause our Earth’s temperature to increase. This is why there have been colder winters and hotter summers or more extreme weather events. You may be asking yourself, how do we know climate change is happening? Well, take a look at the graph below. This graph shows the annual temperature anomalies (or differences from the mean of 0). As seen, the graph has a positive correlation between time and temperature.

    "text": "Mediterranean wrasses are a bright-colored fish species belonging to the Labridae family. Most wrasses inhabit the tropical and subtropical waters of the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans. Wrasses are usually found in shallow-water habitats such as coral reefs and rocky shores.\n\n\n\nImage Caption:Two types of Mediterranean wrasses: Coris julis (top) and Thalassoma pavo (bottom), Source: Science Direct Article\n\n\n\nWhy the Mediterranean Sea?\nTo understand how climate change affects population dynamics in marine biological systems, we focus on temperature fluctuations in the Mediterranean Sea. Scientific literature and conducted studies propose that global warming can induce organisms to adapt or move to track thermal optima, ultimately resulting in spatio-temporal changes (Milazzo et al., 2016). The Mediterranean Sea has sensibly warmed over the past three decades, with an average 0.03°C/year increase in the Western basin and a 0.05°C/year increase in the Eastern basin (Milazzo et al., 2016). The sped up rate at which temperature in the Mediterranean rises makes it an interesting case study.\n\n\nWhat fish species?\nIn this project, we explore the patterns of distribution and abundance of two ecologically similar species: the rainbow wrasse Coris julis and the ornate wrasse Thalassoma pavo. The Coris julis is a cool-water species common in shallow algal beds along the northern coast of the Mediterranean, while the ornate wrasse is a thermophilic species more abundant along the southern coast. Selection of these particular species stems from previous findings that in warmer conditions, the ‘cool water’ species is competitively displaced from preferred algal habitat to seagrass habitat because of the rising temperatures. Thus, observing changes in distribution and abundance of these two species provides a unique opportunity to exlore temperature-dependent interspecific interactions in the animal kingdom and to understand how future climate conditions can result in a readjustment of habitat occupancy and species competition.\n\n\nData, Visualization, and Results\nFor this project, we observe distribution and abundance patterns using spatio-temporal data. In an attempt to understand the relationship between wrasse distrubution/abundance and sea surface temperatures, two different data sets are joined and spatially overlapped. Data was obtained from the Sea Scientifc Open Data Publication and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\nIn order to join the two data sets, each data set was cleaned by scaling variables, removing decimal points when appropriate and overlapping both data sets on a range of longitude and latitude points covering the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nThe Poisson Model: Modeling fish predictions\nIn order to understand the impacts of rising SST on wrasse distribution, a poisson model was fit. The poisson model is a discrete probability distribution that expresses the probability of a given number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space. For our model, we attempt to predict the most likely distribution and abundance (count) of both Coris julis and Thalassoma Pavo in the Mediterranean Sea. As our selected interval of time, we picked two years: August 2015 and August 2016. These years were selected because they fit into the category of years affected very strongly by El Niño according to the Oceanic Niño Index (ONI) (ONI categories).\nThe following visualization shows the modeled predictions for abundance (count) of both Coris julis and Thalassoma pavo in relation to sea surface temperature (°C) for the months of August-November before and after 2015.The graph shows how, before 2015, there was positive correlation between Thalassoma pavo counts and SST. Coris julis count, on the other hand, had a tendency to decrease as SST increased. After 2015, both Thalassoma pavo and Coris julis counts significantly decreased as SST increased.\n\n\nCode\nNewDat %>% \n  mutate(FishType = ifelse(FishType == \"Coris_julis\", \"C. julis\", \"T. pavo\")) %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x = sst, y = Pred, color = FishType)) + \n  geom_point() + \n  facet_grid(TimePeriod~Month) +\n  labs(title = \"Predictions for average count of C. julis and T. pavo before and after 2015\",\n       subtitle = \"(in relation to sea surface temperature)\",\n       caption = \"Graphic by L.

The range of temperatures depends on the average sea surface temperatures recorded in the Mediterranean throughout the years.\n\n\nCode\ntmp <- medSeaTemp %>% filter(year %in% c(2015,2016),month == 7) \n\nggplot() + \n  geom_tile(data = tmp, aes(x = lon,y = lat , fill = sst),width = 2,height= 2) + \n  geom_sf(data = world_sf) + \n  coord_sf(xlim =  c(-17.14,45.44), ylim = c(25.80, 51.29)) + \n  scale_fill_gradient(low='blue',high='red') + \n  facet_grid(.~year) +\n  labs(fill = 'Temperature (ºC)', \n       title = 'Mediterranean Sea Surface Temperature Trends (July 2015/2016)', \n       caption = \"Map by L.

The maps show how,Coris julis populations have a tendency to congregate in the colder regions of the Mediterranean. The distribution and abundance of Thalassoma pavo is pretty uniform across the map, reinforcing the species’s thermophilic attributes.\n\n\nCode\nworld <- get_stamenmap(\n  bbox = c(left = -17.14, bottom = 25.80, right = 45.44, top = 51.29),\n  maptype = \"toner\",\n  zoom = 6\n  )\n\nworld_sf <- ne_countries(scale = 'medium',returnclass = 'sf')\n\ntmp2 <- medSeaTemp %>% \n  filter(year %in% c(2015,2016),month == 7) %>% \n  dplyr::rename(Year = year, Month = month) \n\ntmp2 <- tmp2 %>% mutate(FishType = 'Coris_julis') %>% bind_rows(tmp2 %>% mutate(FishType = 'Thalassoma_pavo'))\n\ntmp2 <- tmp2 %>% mutate(pred = predict(fish_mod2,newdata = tmp2 ,type='response')) %>% filter(!is.na(pred))\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_tile(data = tmp2, aes(x = lon,y = lat , fill = pred),width = 2,height= 2) + \n  geom_sf(data = world_sf) + \n  coord_sf(xlim =  c(-17.14,45.44), ylim = c(25.80, 51.29)) + \n  scale_fill_gradient(low='white',high='green') + \n  facet_grid(FishType~Year) + \n  labs(fill = 'Predict Fish Count', \n       title = 'Predicted count and distribution of C. julis and T. pavo in the Mediterranean Sea \\n (July 2015/2016) ',\n       caption = \"Graphic by L.
